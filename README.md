# Ceprit
A C++ ray tracer following the ray tracer in one weekend series.

FYI "Ceprit" is how I would pronounce "CPRT" for "C Plusplus Ray Tracer".

## TODO Items
* Finish the third book to end up where it leaves off
* Do the rest of the refactoring/code arrangement to clean up where files are and remove implementation of functions from header files
* Write output to file from code rather than to command line; will allow things like timing performance and errors/debugging to be written to the console instead of the image data
* Use data read from a file to construct scenes so that a different scene doesn't require recompilation.
* Profile performance to determine where bottlenecks are.
